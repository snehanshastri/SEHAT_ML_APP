# SEHAT_ML_APP
A personalized health recommendation model for women's healthcare.

To run the model please follow these steps:
-> Open the google colab link in a new tab (please request for access as currently anyone with the link has only viewer access).
-> Download the dataset given.
-> In the colab link upload the dataset via upload to sessions storage as the uploaded data only lasts for one session in colab.
-> Copy the file path after the file has been uploaded and paste it in place of the current path in the code in line 8.
-> Run the code cell. Give inputs of your choice to obtain personalized recommendations!

This model uses Hierarchical Clustering and Gausian Mixture Models.

The model will be integrated into a react native mobile application which can then be easily accessed by women across the country.
